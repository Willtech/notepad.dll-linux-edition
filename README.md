# Notepad.sh (Linux Edition)

> A ritualistic text editor launcher that simulates the loading of every Windows DLL—just in case typing requires spiritual validation from Win32.

## 🧪 What It Does

- Loads a list of Windows `.DLL`s (symbolically)
- Launches a text editor (`nano`) once all DLLs are “loaded”
- Prints session completion message with mythic resonance

## 🔧 How to Use

```bash
chmod +x notepad.sh
./notepad.sh
